 # üè¢ Create Custom AI Agents From Scratch for Any real world use case üè¢

In this project, we'll build a Simple AI Agent that performs "Text Analysis". This tutorial will help you understand the fundamentals of creating an AI agent and working with natural language processing.

## Prerequisites:

* Python 3.7+ installed on your system
* Basic understanding of Python programming
* Familiarity with command-line interfaces
* Basic knowledge of virtual environments

## Steps:

1. **Virtual Environment Setup:**

   Virtual environments help isolate project dependencies. Let's create one for our AI agent.

   - Open your terminal or command prompt
   - Navigate to your project directory
   - Create a new virtual environment:
   
     ```bash
     python -m venv How_I_Built_Custom_Multi_AI_Agents_From_Scratch 
     ```

   - Activate the environment:
   
     * On Windows:
        ```bash
        How_I_Built_Custom_Multi_AI_Agents_From_Scratch\Scripts\activate
        ```
     * On Unix or MacOS:
        ```bash
        source How_I_Built_Custom_Multi_AI_Agents_From_Scratch/bin/activate
        ```

   You should now see your terminal prompt change, indicating the virtual environment is active.

2. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   We'll use several Python libraries for our AI agent. Let's install them:

   - Ensure you're in your project directory with the virtual environment activated
   - Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:
     ```
     streamlit
     requests
     ```
   - Install the dependencies using pip:
   
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   This will install Streamlit for creating the web interface and LangChain for building the AI agent.

3. **Setup Ollama:**

   Ollama is an easy-to-use framework for running large language models locally.

   - Download Ollama from https://ollama.com/download
   - Install Ollama following the instructions for your operating system
   - Once installed, open a new terminal and pull the LLaMA model:
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
   This may take some time depending on your internet connection.



4. **Run the AI Agent:**

   Now that we have our script ready, let's run it:

   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated
   - In your terminal, navigate to your project directory
   - Run the Streamlit app:
   
     ```bash
     python -m src.main
     
     streamlit run Our_Simple_Agent.py
     ```

   This will start a local web server and open the AI agent interface in your default web browser.

Congratulations! You've just built a simple AI agent for text analysis. You can now enter text into the interface, click "Analyze", and receive insights from the AI model.

Remember to always activate your virtual environment when working on this project, and feel free to modify the script to add more features or improve the analysis capabilities.
